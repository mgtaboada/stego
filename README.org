* Stego
A steganography project using the least significant bit method.
** LSB method
This method encodes the message in the least siginificant bit of each "word" of the file.
In the case of images, this "word" is each R,G and B value of each pixel. Therefore, the
capacity of a photo is more or less (3*M*N)/8, being N and M the pixels per row and per
column of the photo.

** Encryption
In order to make the steganographied image indistinguishible from an original one
(without having access to the original), the hidden message is encrypted using AES-256
 and a given password. Thus, the analysis of the least significant bits of each word
may not yield any result on whether it contains a secret message or not.
